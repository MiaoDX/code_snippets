# Gathering of cloth simulation projects

I think Computer Graphics is kinda of too complex to be mastered, but some experiments are valuable. I github/googled some of the projects on cloth simulation and make one small list:

# Projects

NOTE: YOU can always github to get more.

* [kevenv/3d-cloth-sim](https://github.com/kevenv/3d-cloth-sim), the codes smells nice, use irrlicht engine
* [A collection of source codes implementing cloth simulation algorithms in OpenGL ](https://github.com/mmmovania/opencloth), the projects are self-contained in one file.
* [PositionBasedDynamics is a library for the physically-based simulation of rigid bodies, deformable solids and fluids.](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/PositionBasedDynamics), a big one.
* [Position-Based Dynamics in OpenCL, homework in Stanford's CS348C](https://github.com/bwiberg/position-based-dynamics), not so big.

# Libraries

* [Full List Of Open Source Physics Engines](https://www.tapirgames.com/blog/open-source-physics-engines)
* [A Processing/Java library for high performance GPU-Computing (GLSL). Fluid Simulation + SoftBody Dynamics + Optical Flow + Rendering + Image Processing + Particle Systems + Physics](https://github.com/diwi/PixelFlow), for java.
* [Fluid simulation engine for computer graphics applications](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev)
* [A modern particle engine running on GPU, using c++14 and OpenGL 4.4.](https://github.com/tcoppex/sparkle)
