I am like a boy collecting sea-shells in a beach, and I know I am not alone, how many times you star a project in github and leave that alone? Well, this repo contains some of the *interesting* projects I encountered in the browsing and surfing, and some codes come from no where.

Once I have a project named `practice`, whose description is as follows:

> ## All it starts ..
<br>
I found someone have a `practice` repo on gihub long time ago,he puts `demo` programming works there and when they are big or good enough,they will move to their new repo.
<br>
And have a practice repo will save me from lots of repos in one github account.it really helps,for I really dislike it when I have to click `next,next,next` when I visit other person's github.(Well,I just want to surf them all -.-)
<br>
It seems nice,so I just have a try. ^_^

And that repo is deleted by me since I failed to put some valuable codes there, but months latter, I opened a new one just like that, what a shame.
